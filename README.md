# SPIonic-to-Unicode
A TECkit Mapping from the non-Unicode SPIonic font to Unicode.

TECkit: https://software.sil.org/teckit/

Font: https://www.inthebeginning.org/ntgreek/spionic.html

Font Mapping: https://www.drshirley.org/fonts/SPIonic.html and https://www.tertullian.org/support/SPIonic.htm

Why not use the online Converter: https://noahfrederick.com/spionic-unicode-converter/ code here: https://github.com/noahfrederick/spionic
Because we needed to mix the conversion in the document with other text and we have dozens of documents.
